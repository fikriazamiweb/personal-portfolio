<center><h3 style="color: white">Once the Malaysian Government Movement Control Order (MCO) has allowed to cross the state. We have planned to go on vacation. My family and I agreed to go on holiday to Cameron Highlands. My family and I find it difficult to get together and go on vacation. Due to the MCO that has been implemented by the work, we were able to go on vacation together and at the same time we were able to further strengthen family ties. We also do not neglect the safety and personal care aspects while on vacation together.</h3></center>
